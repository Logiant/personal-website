                    <h1>Mechatronic Crane</h1>
                    <p>A mechatronic crane system built over the fall semester of 2015. The entire system was fabricated, wired, and programmed within the span of a couple months. Powered by an Arduino Mega 2650 running Simulink, the system positions an end effector in real time based on user input from a custom Matlab GUI.</p>

                    <h1>Mass Transport Via Diffusion</h1>
                    <p>To determine the useful lifespan of an Expo dry erase marker an analytical model of the marker was developed and compared to experimental data. Using a custom built whiteboard turntable the marker drew for six hours and was weighed intermittently. The results? Dry erase markers are good for about three hours of constant writing.</p>

                    <h1>Pneumatic Walking Robot</h1>
                    <p>As a capstone research project at the Milwaukee School of Engineering a pneumatic walking robot was designed and built. It included a sophisticated control system running on an Arduino Mega 2650 powered by onboard battery and pneumatic valve manifold. The entire system was controlled wirelessly using an Xbox 360 controller running through a custom Java GUI. In addition a full kinematic and dynamic model of the robot were created and used to support the design.</p>
